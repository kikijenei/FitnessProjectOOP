# oop.fitness.project
This project is an extended version of my OOP Fitness application, developed using Java, JavaFX with SceneBuilder, and SQLite (via DB Browser). It features a login/sign-up system with distinct roles: Client, Trainer, and Admin, each with role-specific access and functionality.

The app demonstrates strong object-oriented design principles and offers a practical, interactive GUI for managing fitness data such as user profiles, workouts, and progress tracking.

Key Features

  - User authentication (login/sign-up)

  - Role-based access control (Client, Trainer, Admin)

  - Data persistence via SQLite

  - Intuitive JavaFX interface built with SceneBuilder

In the near future, I plan to further develop the project by expanding the functionality of each user role, improving the user interface, adding visual representations of progress, and enhancing overall security.
